# ElTween
### What is this?

A simpler more straight forward animation option than manual keys made for easy twining in Houdini when you need more control.

### Install instructions:

Copy **packages/elTween.json** to your **houdini20.0/packages/** folder in your My Documents (if you don't have one make one)

Copy the folder `elTween` to your **houdin20.0/** `folder` in your My Documents so it's **houdin20.0/elTween**

**Done!** Press Tab in sop view and start typing elTween and you should see it.

#### Requirements: Houdini 20 Indie

### How to use:

Press Tab, type in el Tween and place it under your object you want to animate. Then hit the big buttons on the left for Position/Rotation/Scale/Skew Or their tiny versions on the right for using only one axis. That's pretty much it!

### Easing:

I've added Easing options including your standard eases, in out, and also Elastic and Bounce which can be controlled by the Overshoot and Amplitude sliders

### Staggers:

Because of the fact that elTween is point based not packed object based you can Stagger on the stagger tab. Specify the amount and the pivot of the stagger(how far away the stagger point is from the center of the object) and you can make some nice smear action!

And that's it!

Happy tweening
